# Ensure proper workspace handling

# Use prefer-online instead of deprecated cache-max
prefer-online=true

# NOTE: "Unknown env config" warnings about verify-deps-before-run and _jsr-registry
# are coming from an external source (not this file). They're harmless but annoying.
# See: .docs/tmp/npm-warnings-research-and-solution.md for full analysis.
# Decision: Accept the warnings for now (they don't affect functionality)
